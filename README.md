# decode
Python functions that can decode text coded with Caesar's cipher with varying offsets, as well as Vigenere's cipher.

The first cell contains a function to decode text coded with Caeser's cipher with an offset of 10 letters.  The second function allows the user to specify the offset used to code the text and decode input text based on that offset.

The second cell contains a function which allows for a user to encode a string of text with Caeser's cipher at an offset of 10.

The fifth cell contains a function to decode a string encoded with Vigenere's cipher which codes a string with a keyword.  The user inputs the encoded string and the keyword and the output is the string decoded.

The sixth cell allows for the user to encode a string of text with Vigenere's cipher and a keyword of their choosing.
